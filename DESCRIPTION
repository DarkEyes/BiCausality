Description: A framework to infer causality on binary data using techniques in frequent pattern mining and estimation statistics. Given a set of individual vectors S={x} where x(i) is a realization value of binary variable i, the framework infers empirical causal relations of binary variables i,j from S in a form of causal graph G=(V,E) where V is a set of nodes representing binary variables and there is an edge from i to j in E if the variable i causes j. The framework determines dependency among variables as well as analyzing confounding factors before deciding whether i causes j.  The publication of this package is at <arXiv:2205.06131>.
