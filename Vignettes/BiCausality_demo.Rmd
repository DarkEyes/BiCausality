Example: Inferred binary causal graph from simulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first step, we generate a simulation dataset as an input.
```{r}
seedN<-2022

n<-200 # 200 individuals
d<-10 # 10 variables
mat<-matrix(nrow=n,ncol=d) # the input of framework

#Simulate binary data from binomial distribution where the probability of value being 1 is 0.5.
for(i in seq(n))
{
  set.seed(seedN+i)
  mat[i,] <- rbinom(n=d, size=1, prob=0.5)
}

mat[,1]<-mat[,2] | mat[,3]  # 1 causes by 2 and 3
mat[,4] <-mat[,2] | mat[,5] # 4 causses by 2 and 5
mat[,6] <- mat[,1] | mat[,4] # 6 causes by 1 and 4

```

We use the following function to infer whether X causes Y.
``` r
# Run the function
library(BiCausality)
resC<-BiCausality::CausalGraphInferMainFunc(mat = mat,CausalThs=0.1, nboot =50, IndpThs=0.05)
```
The result of the ajacency matrix of the directed causal graph is below:

```{r}
resC$CausalGRes$Ehat
```
The value in the element EValHat[i,j] represents that i causes j if the value is not zero. For example, EValHat[2,1] = 1 implies node 2 causes node 1, which is correct since node 1 have nodes 2 and 3 as causal nodes.

The directed causal graph also can be plot using the code below.
```{r}
library(igraph)
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(resC$CausalGRes$Ehat ,weighted = NULL)
plot(net, edge.arrow.size = 0.2, vertex.size =20 , vertex.color = '#D4C8E9',layout=layout_with_kk)
```


For the causal relation of variables 2 and 1, we can use the command below to see further information.

**Note that the odd difference between X and Y denoted oddDiff(X,Y) is define as
|P (X = 1, Y = 1) P (X = 0, Y = 0) âˆ’P (X = 0, Y = 1) P (X = 1, Y = 0)|.  If X is directly proportional to Y, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to 1. If X is inverse of Y, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to -1. If X and Y have no association, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to zero.

```{r}
resC$CausalGRes$causalInfo[['2,1']]
```
Below are the details of result explanation.
