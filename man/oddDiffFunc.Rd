\title{oddDiffFunc function}
\usage{
oddDiffFunc(D, i, j, z = c(), slack = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{is an aligned list of transactions that was converted from \code{mat}.}

\item{i}{is an ith dimension in \code{mat} for computing the odd difference with.}

\item{j}{is an jth dimension in \code{mat} for computing compute the odd difference with.}

\item{z}{is a conditioning d-dimensional vector on \code{D}.
Given k non-negative-bit positions of \code{z}, all k bit positions of samples in the subset of \code{D} must have similar values with these bits.}
}
\value{
This function returns an odd difference value of variables of ith and jth dimensions from \code{D}.
}
\description{
Given the samples in the n by d matrix \code{mat} where n is a number of samples and d is a number of dimensions.
This function computes an odd difference value of variables of ith and jth dimensions from
a given an aligned list of transactions \code{D} (compute by \code{D<-VecAlignment(mat)}).
