A framework to infer causality on binary data using frequent pattern minging and estimation statistics. Given a set of individual vectors S={x} where x(i) is a realization value of binary variable i, the framework infer empirical causal relations of binary variables i,j from S in a form of causal graph G=(V,E) where V is a set of nodes representing binary variables and there is an edge from i to j in E if the variable i causes j. The framework determines dependency among variables as well as analyzing confounding factors before decide whether i causes j. 

Note: The causal relations inferred by this work is not the real causal relations; they are empirical causal relations that needed
to be validated. Our main goal is to develop an exploratory data analysis tools to pinpoint possible causal relations to support
researchers before the validation in the field studies to find real causal relations. 

Installation
------------

For the newest version on github, please call the following command in R terminal.


``` r
remotes::install_github("DarkEyes/BiCausality")
```
This requires a user to install the "remotes" package before installing BiCausality.


Example: Inferred binary causal graph from simulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first step, we generate a simulation dataset as an input.
``` r
seedN<-2022

n<-200 # 200 individuals
d<-10 # 10 variables
mat<-matrix(nrow=n,ncol=d) # the input of framework

#Simulate binary data from binomial distribution where the probability of value being 1 is 0.5.
for(i in seq(n))
{
  set.seed(seedN+i)
  mat[i,] <- rbinom(n=d, size=1, prob=0.5)
}

mat[,1]<-mat[,2] | mat[,3]  # 1 causes by 2 and 3
mat[,4] <-mat[,2] | mat[,5] # 4 causses by 2 and 5
mat[,6] <- mat[,1] | mat[,4] # 6 causes by 1 and 4

```

We use the following function to infer whether X causes Y.
```{r}
# Run the function
library(BiCausality)
resC<-BiCausality::CausalGraphInferMainFunc(mat = mat,CausalThs=0.1, nboot =50, IndpThs=0.05)
```
The result of the ajacency matrix of the directed causal graph is below:

```r
resC$CausalGRes$Ehat
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
 [1,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    0    0     0
 [2,]    1    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [3,]    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [4,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    0    0     0
 [5,]    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [6,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [7,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [8,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
 [9,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
[10,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0
```
The value in the element EValHat[i,j] represents that i causes j if the value is not zero. For example, EValHat[2,1] = 1 implies node 2 causes node 1, which is correct since node 1 have nodes 2 and 3 as causal nodes.

The directed causal graph also can be plot using the code below.
```r
library(igraph)
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(resC$CausalGRes$Ehat ,weighted = NULL)
plot(net, edge.arrow.size = 0.2, vertex.size =20 , vertex.color = '#D4C8E9',layout=layout_with_kk)
```
The plot is below.

For the causal relation of variables 2 and 1, we can use the command below to see further information.

**Note that the odd difference between X and Y denoted oddDiff(X,Y) is define as
|P (X = 1, Y = 1) P (X = 0, Y = 0) âˆ’P (X = 0, Y = 1) P (X = 1, Y = 0)|.  If X is directly proportional to Y, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to 1. If X is inverse of Y, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to -1. If X and Y have no association, then oddDiff(X,Y) is close to zero.

```r
resC$CausalGRes$causalInfo[['2,1']]
```
Suppose Y is variable 1 and X is variable 2, the results are below.

```r
